# SpaceColonization

Runs the space colonization algorithm as described by Adam Runions et al. (2007). 

The notebook *Space Colonization Demo.ipynb* shows how to use the code with some examples.

## Recent addition:
Added a new function, *spacecol2()*, which contains probabilistic form of the Runions algorithm that restricts branch movement to uncertain, planar directions, designed for simulating flow through fractures. Currently only accommodates a single fracture set, but more work is being done to allow any number of user-defined fracture sets.

New Jupyter notebooks will come out to show how to use the new features once multiple fracture sets have been implemented.
